        CommTone Serial port testing , can improve the development efficiency, eliminating the pain of debugging serial programs.

Support the common 110-115200bps baud rate, parity can be set, data and stop bits can be in ASCII or hexadecimal receiving or sending any data or characters (including Chinese), can be set automatically send cycle.

       The new version adds send files, send documents to support 4GB size.
